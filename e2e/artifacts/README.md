# E2E Artifact Fixtures

These fixtures are generated by an external artifact producer command.
`e2e/scripts/regenerate_artifacts.sh` keeps `artifact.yml` as producer output and only removes
`runtime-base/**` (outside deploy artifact contract scope).
Do not edit files under this directory manually.

Regenerate all fixtures with:

```bash
./e2e/scripts/regenerate_artifacts.sh
```

Set `ARTIFACT_PRODUCER_CMD` to your artifact producer invocation.

```bash
ARTIFACT_PRODUCER_CMD='your-producer-cli' ./e2e/scripts/regenerate_artifacts.sh
```

Notes:
- The script writes both generated files and `artifact.yml` directly into `e2e/artifacts/*`.
- The script uses environment-specific tags (`e2e-docker-latest`, `e2e-containerd-latest`) to avoid cross-environment image collisions.
- The script fails if the generated manifest mode does not match the requested mode.
- The script fails if generated manifest entries contain `id`, or if `source_template.path` / `source_template.sha256` are missing.
- The script removes `<artifact_root>/runtime-base/**` from fixtures after generation.
