# Milestone 1 Plan: Seed esb-cli Repository with Existing cli/ History

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

This document must be maintained in accordance with `.agent/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Create initial `esb-cli` repository content from existing `cli/` subtree while preserving commit history.

## Progress

- [ ] Create subtree split branch for `cli/`.
- [ ] Push subtree split branch to `esb-cli` repository.
- [ ] Verify remote branch content and record seed commit.

## Surprises & Discoveries

To be filled during implementation.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Push to `main` in empty target repository.
  Rationale: repository is empty and requires initial default branch content.
  Date/Author: 2026-02-20 / Codex

## Outcomes & Retrospective

To be filled after implementation.

## Validation and Acceptance

- `esb-cli` has commit history and files from `cli/`.
- `main` branch exists in target repository.

## Revision Notes

- 2026-02-20: Initial milestone detail created.
